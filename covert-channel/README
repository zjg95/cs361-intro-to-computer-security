[Program 1]
[Description]
There are seven .java files: CovertChannel.java is the main file that runs this program. It reads the input file and converts it into individual bits, which are then used to determine the actions of Hal/Lyle. InstructionObject.java is the data structure for an instruction. ObjectManager.java performs the actions parsed by the CovertChannel.java. SecurityLevel.java is a data structure for a security level. sObject.java is the data structure for an object. Subject.java is the data structure for a subject. Timer.java is used for the timing portion. The average bandwidth of the system is 277 bits/ms. This data was collected on a system running an Intel i7-3770 CPU @3.40GHz.

[Finish]
The whole assignment is finished, minus the extra credit. There are no known bugs. When running the program with the "v" argument the program does not run a timer, as specified in the assignment instructions. When the program is run without the verbose argument it will print the bandwidth of the system.
